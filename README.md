# NemmiProtoDue Experiment
What is this?

This repository compiles all collected data for the NemmiProtoDue experiment. It also stores the statistical analyses run, and generated outputs.

This experiment aimed to study the impact of multimodal feedback on basic musical tasks in mobile-based musical applications.

It is also part of the larger project *Nemmi*.

## What is Nemmi?

*Nemmi* stands for *Non-Emulative Mobile Musical Instrument* and is the PhD project of Alexandre Clément, Digital Media PhD candidate at [FEUP](https://www.fe.up.pt).
Mobile musical instruments are abundant in the mobile app stores, but most either attempt to emulate traditional musical instruments or approach their interaction and interface design with very specific methods. There is no such thing as a uniformized way of interacting and controlling musical instruments on handheld devices, especially one that is designed with the particularities of those devices in mind.
*Nemmi* is an attempt to exactly that: design a mobile musical instrument that is anchored in user-experience and developed with handheld device operation and specificities in mind.
